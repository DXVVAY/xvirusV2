# This project is NOT my best work. Do not judge me on my ability to code on this. + It is **VERY** flagged :kek: 

XvirusV2 was fully coded and maintained by me (dexv) all other retards "developers" had nothing to do with this

I decided to release it since adminx (selfish retard) was being a asshole, and decided to **leak** the src.
```py 
print("diggers rhymes with what?")
```
# Adminx is a skid

well, he never could code. Always regreted asking him to code with me, all he did was blackmail me to pay him or he would leak the source even tho he didnt contribute to the project at all.

## "his" fire project

# XvirusV2 Breakdown
Xvirus raider consists of two components:

Core 1: plugins - proprietary components by XUS: settings + primary utilities. XUS stands for Xvirus Utilities, which contains Config, Logging, Headers, Session and Solvers.

Core 2: Functions - Discord API edpoints + User Input + Threading.

The main.py imports should be compiled in the order described.

# Xvirus Session Breakdown
Xvirus session system consists of three components:

1. Headers: [
   * gets the app version through [Discord App (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-chat-talk-hangout/id985746746)
   * uses the app version to get the build number from the latest manifest [discord.com/ios/(app_version)/manifest.json](https://discord.com/ios/206.0/manifest.json)
   * utilizes **uuid** package to randomize the vendor id and the iphone module
   * builds the x_super_properties using the previous gathered information
   * and then fnally returns the freshly built headers
     
   ]

1. Tls_session: utilizes **tls_client** to make a secure connection.

2. Cookies: uses the current session to get the cookies from [discord.com](https://discord.com) and them uses them as the session cookies

Finally it uses the headers to send requests to the discord API very securely
